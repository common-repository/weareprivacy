Auto highlight important keywords on any privacy policy or terms of service so users can quickly find and understand critical sections.

== Description ==

Auto highlight important keywords on any privacy policy or terms of service so users can quickly find and understand critical sections.

Works with the below popular policy pages on your website automatically:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Cookie Policy
- Disclosure Policy
- Disclaimer Policy
- Code of Conduct

Also works with many pages like:

- Legal pages
- Contract Signing pages
- Confirmation pages
- Agreement pages
- GDPR pages

Keywords will be highlighted automatically as your users browse your website and visit policy-related pages. Hovering over any highlighted keyword will show them information about why that keyword may be vital. The highlighted keywords allow your users to find sections they should focus on quickly without having to read the entire policy and feel overwhelmed. 

Policy highlights save your users time and allow them to do a better job caring about their personal privacy.

Features:
- Primary keywords highlighted in yellow.
- Secondary keywords highlighted in orange.
- Hover over keyword details.
- Easy On/Off switch to activate or disable Policy Highlighting.

Why did we create policy highlights? 

Like us, you probably ignored a websites privacy policy and terms of service. You clicked "I accept" and moved on. But as the number of data breaches increased so did your concern for privacy, so you started to care. You tried to take a minute to read and understand each privacy policy or terms of service, but there where too many words to skim through.

Glad you found us because we had the same problem.

We started working on an open-source tool to automatically highlight important keywords and action words in policy documents. Hovering over each highlighted word told you what you can expect in that section. The tool has improved our readability of every privacy policy and terms of service we read from now on.

Do you care about your privacy? Want to quickly understand different policies?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are important privacy keywords automatically highlighted? =

Yes.

= Can I modify the keywords to highlight? =

Policy Highlights is an open-source library and contains a configuration file of the keywords to automatically highlight. For the moment we do not allow you to edit the list of keywords to highlight since that would allow any website to specify different keywords. We would like keyword highlighting to be 3rd party independent and consistent across different websites so the user can feel safe. If you would like to suggest changes to the keyword configuration, please contribute to the development community on GitHub.

= Is the project multilingual? =

The project is currently only in English. We are working on adding other languages. If you would like to help, please contribute to the development community on GitHub.

= How does Policy Highlights know when to highlight vital keywords? =

Policy Highlights checks for privacy-related trigger words in the page title and URL. If a page trigger is found, Policy Highlights will be started, otherwise Policy Highlights will not be loaded on the page. You can modify the trigger word list on the plugin options page under the "Page triggers" section.
